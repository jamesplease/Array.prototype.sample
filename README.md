# `Array.prototype.sample` Proposal

## Motivation

When using ECMAScript arrays, it is commonly desired to retrieve an element at a pseudo-random index. The prevailing pattern for this is

```
var randomElement = function(elementList) {
  var randomNumber = Math.random();
  var maxSize = elementList.length;
  var index = Math.floor(randomNumber*maxSize);
  return elementList[index];
}

randomElement(arr);
```

The prevailing pattern requires that we pass the collection to a utility method that then returns an element from the collection. Ideally, however, we want to be asking the Array itself to return an element it contains, without the mediation of a utility method.

## Proposed Solution

We propose the addition of an `Array.prototype.sample` method, such that the above pattern can be written as

```
var arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
arr.sample();
// => [3]
arr.sample(2);
// => [6,2]

var arr2 = [];
arr.sample();
// => []
arr.sample(3);
// => []

```

The sample function would choose a random element, or the random `n` elements, from the array.

## FAQs

### Why `sample` instead of `random`?

We rejected the term `random()` as it is used in the `Math` library already and we didn't wish to overload the term.

The term `sample()` was taken from the [Array#sample method introduced in Ruby 1.9.1 core](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.1/Array.html#method-i-sample). We like that it is unlike any other name in the current namespace and that it makes sense with selecting both one or multiple elements from an array. It is also implemented by Lodash.
